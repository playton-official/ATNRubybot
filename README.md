# ATNtgbot
This bot takes posts from the altenen.com forum and redirects them to telegram.

<b>INSTALLATION</b>
Download the ruby package, here are some links that could be for you:

» <a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/">Ruby, windows version</a><br />
» <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/it/downloads/">Ruby, linux version</a><br />
<br />

Configure the source by replacing "<b>TOKEN!</b>" with your token and "<b>CHATID!</b>" with the group chat_id where you would like to receive posts... Now, start the bot by doing in the terminal and in the main file directory:<br /><br />
<code>ruby main.rb</code>
<br /><br />
It's very easy, try it! Good luck!
